# Affiliate
an affiliate is an independent party that promotes products or services of a company (the merchant) and earns a commission for every sale or action generated through their marketing efforts. Affiliates typically use unique tracking links or codes to identify the traffic or sales they generate, allowing the merchant to attribute commissions accurately. This model is commonly used in e-commerce and online businesses as a way to expand reach and increase sales through a network of affiliates.
